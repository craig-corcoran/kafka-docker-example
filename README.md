This is a small example of using `kafka-node` with the `ches/kafka` and `zookeeper` docker images.

## Getting Started

`docker-compose build`

`docker-compose up`

Note: There are some timing issues with `ches/kafka` on first `up`. If errors are thrown on up, cancel the process and `docker-compose up` again.
